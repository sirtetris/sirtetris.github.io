1
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,880
Crew: <Name>, <Name>. We're filming, we're filming!

2
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,260
Heh?

3
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,200
Heh?

4
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,680
For real?

5
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,220
What is this?

6
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,340
The thing is huge.

7
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,880
HUGE!

8
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,520
HUGE!

9
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,320
HUGE!

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,720
It's like ... too large.

11
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,080
Why? Why? Why did you build this?

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,180
Is it okay if I take a look?

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,700
Is it okay if I step onto this?

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,140
Is it okay?

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,100
What's up with this?

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,160
What's up with this?

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,380
What? It moves?

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,980
Interpreter: let's do it together slowly.

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,880
How? How?

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,440
How?

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,560
It can be moved from here?

22
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,780
Wow, amazing!

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,180
It moves!

24
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,120
Slowly?

25
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,620
Slowly, slowly.

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,680
Careful...

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,720
It moves!

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,720
Amazing!

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,960
It really moved.

30
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,860
So you can use it like a regular one, right?

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
It really is a Rubik's Cube.

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,160
How long did it take you to build this?

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,520
150 hours over the span of how many days?

34
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,100
One year?

35
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,800
Two months?

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,280
Two months?!

37
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,360
You built all the time over two months?

38
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,480
Huuuh ... it took two months.

39
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,740
Crew: Can it be turned horizontaly and verticaly?

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,320
Can it be turned horizontaly and verticaly?

41
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,740
For real?

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,600
It can be turned horizontaly and verticaly?

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,820
Interpreter: would you like to try it?

44
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,860
I want to try it!

45
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
I want to try it!

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,560
Is it okay to do this?

47
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,720
How are we going to turn it vertically?

48
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,280
What? What? What?

49
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,160
It seems to be quite a hassle.

50
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,660
What? What? What? What?

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,200
What are you doing?

52
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,180
Huh? What's going on?

53
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,940
What are you doing?

54
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,680
What? That takes some trouble!

55
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,500
What's going on?

56
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,880
Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay?

57
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,860
Is everything alright?

58
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,400
Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay?

59
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,600
What are we doing?

60
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,260
We're turning it?

61
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,820
Turning!

62
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,300
Was this vertically?

63
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,100
Ah, you flip it over to turn it vertically.

64
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,760
That takes effort.

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,220
Wow that takes a lot of effort.

66
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,000
It's quite difficult to turn it vertically, right?

67
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,000
How much did it cost you to build this?

68
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,400
How much is 650 Pound?

69
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,360
6.500.000 Yen? 650 Yen?

70
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,200
How much? 650 Yen?

71
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,560
65.000.000.000 Yen?

72
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,180
6.500.000 Yen?

73
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,420
65 Yen?

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,580
Isn't it 650.000 Yen?

75
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,800
How much is 650 Pound?

76
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,360
65 Yen?

77
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,820
It's 650.000 Yen.

78
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,280
Crew: By the way could you ask "Why did you boild it?" one more time?

79
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,960
Crew: Sorry but...

80
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,720
Crew: You, could you get a shot of him alone?

81
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,420
Crew: It's about 110.000 Yen.

82
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,480
110.000 Yen? About 110.000 Yen?

83
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,720
It cost 110.000 Yen...

84
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,620
Crew: The "Why did you build it?" question

85
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,100
So once again.

86
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,620
Here I go.

87
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,580
"Why did you build it?" right?

88
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,920
Why did you build it?

89
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,920
To get a record?

90
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,180
Oh, I see.

91
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,120
Crew: By the way, "Why a Rubik's Cube?".

92
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,040
Why a Rubik's Cube?

93
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,620
I've never solved one.

94
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Oh, wow!

95
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,320
That's fast! He's fast! He's fast!

96
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,320
That's totally fast!

97
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,940
He's a pro! A pro! A pro!

98
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,080
He's fast! He's fast! He's fast!

99
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,980
30 seconds passed.

100
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,600
30 seconds passed.

101
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,260
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! ...

102
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,520
He's fast! He's fast!

103
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,100
40 seconds.

104
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,620
Wow! That's fast! Fast!

105
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,500
IT'S FAST!

106
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,840
50 seconds.

107
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,100
Wow! Wow! Wow! Fast! Fast! Fast!

108
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,820
That's ... He's super fast.

109
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,440
That's super difficult, right?

110
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,020
Wow! It's done!

111
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,200
Incredibly fast!

112
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,360
That was fast!

113
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,040
Really fast!

114
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,200
Crew: "By the way how long does it take to solve that one?"

115
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,560
By the way how long does it take to solve that one?

116
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,300
What? What? What?

117
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,160
That long?

118
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,740
You haven't done it?

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,980
For real?

120
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,280
Why won't you do it?

121
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,140
I'd like to try it.

122
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,140
Now I'd really like to try it.

123
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,600
I haven't solved a regular one even once.

124
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,800
I haven't solved one ever. Not even once.

125
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,760
I guess you'd have to be smart to be able to do this.

126
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,240
It's an interesting thing, isn't it?

127
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,080
Amazing.

128
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,020
Hmm ... is there something else I should ask?

129
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,140
Crew: Let's do the announcing of the quiz answer.

130
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,540
The thing is cute, isn't it?

131
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,260
Here?

132
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,460
Will you stand next to me?

133
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,860
Crew: You say "the correct answer is ..."

134
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,520
Crew: "erm ..."

135
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,480
A Rubik's Cube.

136
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,040
Crew: "Number 2"

137
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,120
Number 2

138
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,380
Crew: "The anwser is ..."

139
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:23,980
Okay.

140
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,440
Crew: Alright, 3, 2, 1.

141
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,340
So, the correct answer is number 2: a Rubuk's Pube.

142
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,580
Can we do that once more?

143
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,300
It's "Rubik's Cube", right?

144
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,460
That's hard to pronounce.

145
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,540
Here I go.

146
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,360
2, 1...

147
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,000
So, the correct answer is number 2: a Rubik's Cube.

148
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,280
Was that right?

149
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,420
It's "Rubik's Cube", right?

150
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,300
Okay, one last time.

151
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:52,680
Once more.

152
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,400
Crew: "So, ..."

153
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,940
So, the correct answer is number 2: a Rubik's Cube.

154
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,060
Here I go.

155
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,660
That means, the correct answer is number 2: a Rubik's Cube.

156
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,980
Yeah!

157
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,260
Crew: Okay, let's do it once more.

158
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,360
Hm?

159
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,480
Crew: "So, ..."

160
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,180
So, the correct answer is ...

161
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,740
Crew: Right.

162
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,100
Crew: "So, he made a giant verison of: a Rubik's Cube, as you can see here."

163
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,180
Okay, here I go.

164
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,540
"So, ...?"

165
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,120
Crew: Right. "... he made a giant verison of: a Rubik's Cube, as you can see here."

166
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,840
"So, he made a giant verison of: ...." Here I go.

167
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,820
So, he made a giant verison of: a Rubik's Cube, as you can see here.

168
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,720
Yeah!

169
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,620
Did it!

170
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,320
Once more.

171
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,040
Crew: You could also say "humongous".

172
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,640
Hm?

173
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,300
Crew: "Huge"

174
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,480
It's huuge!

175
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,940
Crew: Please be careful.

176
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,500
Shoudn't I do that?

177
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,580
Crew: You don't want to break it.

178
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,580
Sorry. Sorry.

179
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,300
Crew: 3, 2, 1.

180
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,380
What do I say?

181
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,860
"So, he made a giant verison of: ..."

182
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,460
Crew: Right.

183
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,100
Crew: 3, 2, 1.

184
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,680
So, the correct answer is: a giant version of a Rubik's Cube.

185
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,000
It's huge!

186
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,200
It's super huge! That's so cool!

187
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,960
Once more?

188
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,180
Is that okay?

189
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,500
It's okay?

190
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,180
Crew: One more take is okay.

191
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,840
Crew: If you're unsure...

192
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,820
What should I do?

193
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,380
Crew: Hah, "What should I do?"

194
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,480
Crew: If there's no other way to do it we're done.

195
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,540
We're okay, right?

196
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,840
Interpreter: Would you like to climb on top of the Cube?

197
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,320
Crew: Huh? You can climb on top?

198
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,620
I want to go on top!

199
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,380
I want to go on top! I want to go on top!

200
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,280
Interpreter: If you don't move too much ...

201
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,120
Crew: If you're calm ...

202
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,780
Crew: If you're calm and don't fool around ...

203
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,460
The thing is super important to him right?

204
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,680
Isn't climbing it risky?

205
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,940
What if I break it?

206
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,440
Interpreter: He's been on it.

207
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,460
I want to go on top! I want to go on top! I want to go on top!

208
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,640
Do I take off my shoes?

209
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,560
Crew: I guess you better take them off.

210
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,000
Right, it's an important thing.

211
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,680
Look at it such a huge version of such a small thing.

212
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,260
Huge versions of things are interesting, aren't they?

213
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,660
Here I go.

214
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,280
That's kind of scary. Will it be okay?

215
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,360
Won't it break? Will it be okay?

216
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,400
Scary. Scary.

217
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,760
Okay, I'm on top.

218
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,480
Wow, that's high up.

219
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,320
I'm on top of a Rubik's Cube.

220
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,980
It's like a dream come true.

221
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,760
Isn't that awesome?

222
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,020
That's so cool!

223
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,000
So, from up there "So, the correct answer is: ..."

224
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,900
So you're shooting just me?

225
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,460
Crew: Yup.

226
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,020
Man that's kind of high up.

227
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,500
I'm kinda scared.

228
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,220
It's quite high.

229
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,840
Crew: Sorry but, could someone put the ladder behind ...

230
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,900
Crew: and her shoes ...

231
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,500
Should I stand?

232
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,720
Should I stand or sit?

233
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,900
Crew: stay like that.

234
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,440
Okay.

235
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,920
"So, the right answer is: number 2 ..."?

236
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,820
Crew: Without the "number 2".

237
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,740
Crew: "he made a giant version of: a Rubik's Cube."

238
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,400
Crew: "he made a giant version of ..."

239
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:11,940
Okay.

240
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,900
Crew: "... a Rubik's Cube."

241
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,200
Okay.

242
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,680
Crew: "he made a giant version of: a Rubik's Cube."

243
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,260
Okay.

244
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,300
Crew: 3, 2, 1.

245
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:24,460
So, the correct answer is: a giant version of a Rubik's Cube.

246
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,020
It's huge!

247
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,900
It's so cool!

248
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,720
I'm super happy!

249
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,720
Yaaay!

250
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,820
That was good, right? (?)

251
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,320
Crew: "He made a giant version of: ..."

252
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,420
"He made a giant version of" alright, once more.

253
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,180
Crew: 3, 2, 1.

254
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,180
So, the correct answer is ...

255
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,680
Can we do that once more?

256
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,940
"So, the correct answer is: a giant version of" alright.

257
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,840
Crew: 3, 2, 1.

258
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,500
So, the correct answer is ...

259
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,340
"a giant version of"?

260
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:58,900
Crew: Yup.

261
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,440
Do we need "the correct answer is"?

262
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,660
Crew: "So, he made a giant version of ..."

263
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,420
Right?

264
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,460
Okay, here I go.

265
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,720
Crew: "a Rubik's Cube."

266
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,360
Okay.

00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,300
Crew: 3, 2, 1.

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,120
So, he made a giant version of: a Rubik's Cube.

269
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,520
It's huge!

270
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,360
It's so cool! I want one!

271
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,100
Bye, bye!

272
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,220
Crew: okay.

273
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,640
Crew: alright, with that we're done.

274
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,380
I'd like to try to build one. (?)

275
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,840
Isn't this awesome?

276
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,680
Isn't this super cute?

277
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,700
Isn't this awesome?

278
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,820
It's like a dream come true, right?

279
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,860
Crew (left): you should turn around.

280
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,880
Why?

281
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,780
Crew (left): For Nakatsuki's ass collection.

282
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,080
No way!

283
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,780
Amazing.

284
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,400
Such a pure hearted fellow. (?)

285
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,260
I want this cube.

286
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,140
I can get off now, right?

287
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,580
Hey, do I get off? Stay on top?

288
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,300
Do I stay on top?

289
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,640
Crew: While we're starting to clean up

290
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,340
Crew: you could put the Cube back to it's solved position.

291
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,160
What shall we do?

292
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,120
Crew: you're okay to get off.

293
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,700
Okay.

294
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,240
I'm getting off. I'm getting off.

295
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,280
That's the best.

296
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,800
Carefully.

297
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,840
That thing is robust.

298
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,980
Crew: could the cube be put back to a solved position?

299
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,100
Amazing.

300
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,120
Aren't your feet freezing?

301
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,660
Crew: isn't it hard to turn?

302
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,080
Interpreter: I think it's best to move it only as much as necessary.

303
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,960
Crew: you're okay to get off.

304
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,500
Okay.
