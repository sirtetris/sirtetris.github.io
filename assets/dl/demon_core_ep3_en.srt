Demon Core

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,280
Hello! I'm the Demon Core.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,020
Before we move on ...

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,120
Who is the Demon Core?

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,440
The Demon Core is a boy that can sometimes be a bit of a troublemaker.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,620
He usually holds a screwdriver in his mouth to prevent it from closing.

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,880
Should it accidentally close, everyone gets obliterated in a burst of bright blue light.

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,060
My washing machine recently breaking obliterated 50,000 Yen btw.

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,340
(distant chatter) Wha? Can you do that again? Wooow.

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,920
Huh, what are they all about?

14
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,200
What's going on here?

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,140
Mh? You came to see the show?

16
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,520
ER

17
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,380
The magican everyone's talking about lately ...

18
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,220
that'd be me!!

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,840
Magican?

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,900
Don't believe me?

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,680
I mean ...

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,880
magicans are just a scam, ripping of gullible people's money, no?

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,000
No need to get offensive mister. You've got the wrong idea.

24
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,160
Let me show you. I'll make this pidgeon dissapear.

25
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,200
Huh? No way you can do that.

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,380
Well, look.

27
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,040
One

28
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,700
Two

29
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,700
Three!!!

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,180
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,600
Woow

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,500
Not only the pidgeon, everyone disappeared.

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,640
If only I had some change on me ...

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,960
That'll do
