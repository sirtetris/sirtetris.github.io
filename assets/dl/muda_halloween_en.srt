Good evening. Fujiwara Marina here.

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,480
I create something useless every Friday,

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,640
Today I'll create a candle in the shape of my face.

00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,520
*Please be careful when using a stove.

7
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,500
And with that, it's done. The wax hardened.

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,100
Let's get it out of the mold.

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,580
I hope it will be easy to get out.

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,800
I got it out of the casting mold.

11
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,220
So, it's time to light it and get some Halloween atmosphere going.

12
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,460
Let's light it.

13
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,020
Romantic

14
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,020
Wasn't that super romantic?

15
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,540
A while ago I also created a chocolate version of my face.
