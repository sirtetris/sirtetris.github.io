Shine!! Demon Core

00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,200
Hello! I'm the Demon Core.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,000
Before we move on ...

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,060
Who is the Demon Core?

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,600
The Demon Core is a boy that can sometimes be a bit of a troublemaker.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,800
He usually holds a screwdriver in his mouth to prevent it from closing.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,360
Should it accidentally close, everyone gets obliterated in a burst of bright blue light.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,040
In case you have friends, please try not to obliterate them.

Hey, it's Demon Core.

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,420
I bet with the screwdriver is his mouth he'll say "textfuck".

18
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,320
